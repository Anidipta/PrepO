# PrepO

> **Learn. Earn. Compete.**  
> A decentralized, AI-driven learning ecosystem where knowledge meets rewards.

---

## 🚀 Overview  

This platform combines **AI**, **blockchain**, and **gamified incentives** to transform how people learn and teach.  
Built on the **CELO blockchain**, it enables **mentors** to create courses and **mentees** to learn, earn, and compete — all transparently and on-chain.

## What Problem We Are Solving

- Learning platforms are centralized and unrewarding.

- No direct financial incentives for learners.

- Mentors struggle to monetize content fairly.

- Engagement is low due to lack of gamification or real-time competition.
